abstract = {In this paper, we describe a representation for spatial
information, called the stochastic map, and associated procedures for building
it, reading information from it, and revising it incrementally as new
information is obtained. The map contains the estimates of relationships among
objects in the map, and their uncertainties, given all the available
information. The procedures provide a general solution to the problem of
estimating uncertain relative spatial relationships. The estimates are
probabilistic in nature, an advance over the previous, very conservative,
worst-case approaches to the problem. Finally, the procedures are developed in
the context of state-estimation and filtering theory, which provides a solid
basis for numerous extensions. {\textcopyright} 1988 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper describes a general method for estimating the nominal
relationship and expected error (covariance) between coordinate frames
representing the relative locations of ob jects. The frames may be known only
indirectly through a series of spatial relationships, each with its associated
error, arising from diverse causes, including positioning errors, measurement
errors, or tolerances in part dimensions. This estimation method can be used
to answer such questions as whether a camera attached to a robot is likely to
have a particular reference object in its field of view. The calculated
estimates agree well with those from an independent Monte Carlo simulation.
The method makes it possible to decide in advance whether an uncertain
relationship is known accu rately enough for some task and, if not, how much
of an improvement in locational knowledge a proposed sensor will provide. The
method presented can be generalized to six degrees offreedom and provides a
practical means of esti mating the relationships ( position and orientation)
among objects, as well as estimating the uncertainty associated with the
relationships.},

@article{Choi2008,
abstract = {This paper describes a geometrically constrained Extended Kalman
Filter (EKF) framework for a line feature based SLAM, which is applicable to a
rectangular indoor environment. Its focus is on how to handle sparse and noisy
sensor data, such as PSD infrared sensors with limited range and limited
number, in order to develop a low-cost navigation system. It has been applied
to a vacuum cleaning robot in our research. In order to meet the real-time
objective with low computing power, we develop an efficient line feature
extraction algorithm based upon an iterative end point fit (IEPF) technique
assisted by our constrained version of the Hough transform. It uses a
geometric constraint that every line is orthogonal or parallel to each other
because in a general indoor setting, most furniture and walls satisfy this
constraint. By adding this constraint to the measurement model of EKF, we
build a geometrically constrained EKF framework which can estimate line
feature positions more accurately as well as allow their covariance matrices
to converge more rapidly when compared to the case of an unconstrained EKF.
The experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness to the
presence of sensor noise and errors in an actual indoor environment.},
