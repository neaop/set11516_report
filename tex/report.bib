information, called the stochastic map, and associated procedures for building
it, reading information from it, and revising it incrementally as new
information is obtained. The map contains the estimates of relationships among
objects in the map, and their uncertainties, given all the available
information. The procedures provide a general solution to the problem of
estimating uncertain relative spatial relationships. The estimates are
probabilistic in nature, an advance over the previous, very conservative,
worst-case approaches to the problem. Finally, the procedures are developed in
the context of state-estimation and filtering theory, which provides a solid

relationship and expected error (covariance) between coordinate frames
representing the relative locations of ob jects. The frames may be known only
indirectly through a series of spatial relationships, each with its associated
error, arising from diverse causes, including positioning errors, measurement
errors, or tolerances in part dimensions. This estimation method can be used
to answer such questions as whether a camera attached to a robot is likely to
have a particular reference object in its field of view. The calculated
estimates agree well with those from an independent Monte Carlo simulation.
The method makes it possible to decide in advance whether an uncertain
relationship is known accu rately enough for some task and, if not, how much
of an improvement in locational knowledge a proposed sensor will provide. The
method presented can be generalized to six degrees offreedom and provides a
practical means of esti mating the relationships ( position and orientation)
among objects, as well as estimating the uncertainty associated with the
relationships.},

Filter (EKF) framework for a line feature based SLAM, which is applicable to a
rectangular indoor environment. Its focus is on how to handle sparse and noisy
sensor data, such as PSD infrared sensors with limited range and limited
number, in order to develop a low-cost navigation system. It has been applied
to a vacuum cleaning robot in our research. In order to meet the real-time
objective with low computing power, we develop an efficient line feature
extraction algorithm based upon an iterative end point fit (IEPF) technique
assisted by our constrained version of the Hough transform. It uses a
geometric constraint that every line is orthogonal or parallel to each other
because in a general indoor setting, most furniture and walls satisfy this
constraint. By adding this constraint to the measurement model of EKF, we
build a geometrically constrained EKF framework which can estimate line
feature positions more accurately as well as allow their covariance matrices
to converge more rapidly when compared to the case of an unconstrained EKF.
The experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness to the
presence of sensor noise and errors in an actual indoor environment.},

challenging problem that involves, at every time instant, the estimation not

target, but also the underlying model accounting for the regime of movement.
In this paper we review and compare several sequential estimation procedures,
that use appropriate strategies for coping with various models that account
for the different modes of operation. We focus on the application of the
recently proposed cost-reference particle filtering (CRPF) methodology,
which aims at the estimation of the system state without using probability
distributions. The resulting method has a more robust performance when
compared to standard particle filtering (SPF) algorithms or the
interactive multiple model (IMM) algorithm based on the use of the well
known extended Kalman filter (EKF). Advantages and disadvantages of the
considered algorithms are illustrated and discussed through computer

abstract={Autonomous learning through interaction with the physical world is a
promising approach to designing controllers and decision-making policies for

number of samples needed for many learning algorithms. Simulators are one way
to decrease the samples needed from the robot by incorporating prior knowledge
of the dynamics into the learning algorithm. In this paper we present a novel
method for transferring data from a simulator to a robot, using simulated data
as a prior for real-world learning. A Bayesian nonparametric prior is learned
from a potentially black-box simulator. The mean of this function is used as a
prior for the Probabilistic Inference for Learning Control (PILCO) algorithm.
The simulated prior improves the convergence rate and performance of PILCO by
directing the policy search in areas of the state-space that have not yet been
observed by the robot. Simulated and hardware results show the benefits of
using the prior knowledge in the learning framework.},

historical contingency in the occurrence order of novel phenotypic traits

However, when the 20 populations were placed in competition with each other,
the populations with the more complex strategy outperformed the populations
with the less complex strategy. These results demonstrate a tradeoff between
communication efficiency and robustness and suggest that stochastic events

abstract={We address the development of the theory and algorithms that can
enable a swarm of inexpensive robots or mobile sensors to create topological
maps of unknown environments without explicitly requiring metric information.
Topological maps are sparse and faithful representations of environments, and
are useful constructions for efficient navigation in GPS-denied environments.
However, in the absence of prior knowledge of the environment, with extremely
limited sensing capabilities, and in an environment without localization, the
construction of a topological map is a challenging problem that has not
received much attention in the literature. In this letter, we present the
algorithmic tools for constructing a topological map of an unknown GPS-denied
environments using a swarm of resource-constrained robots. This method
involves covering the free space, and then constructing an approximate
generalized Voronoi graph of the covered environment. We demonstrate the
algorithm using ROS, first with simulations, and then with experiments using a
combination of real and virtual (simulated) robots.},

abstract = {One of the important challenges in the field of evolutionary
robotics is the development of systems that can adapt to a changing
environment. However, the ability to adapt to unknown and fluctuating
environments is not straightforward. Here, we explore the adaptive potential
of simulated swarm robots that contain a genomic encoding of a bio-inspired
gene regulatory network (GRN). An artificial genome is combined with a
flexible agent-based system, representing the activated part of the regulatory
network that transduces environmental cues into phenotypic behaviour. Using an
artificial life simulation framework that mimics a dynamically changing
environment, we show that separating the static from the conditionally active
part of the network contributes to a better adaptive behaviour. Furthermore,
in contrast with most hitherto developed ANN-based systems that need to
re-optimize their complete controller network from scratch each time they are
subjected to novel conditions, our system uses its genome to store GRNs whose
performance was optimized under a particular environmental condition for a
sufficiently long time. When subjected to a new environment, the previous
condition-specific GRN might become inactivated, but remains present. This
ability to store 'good behaviour' and to disconnect it from the novel rewiring
that is essential under a new condition allows faster re-adaptation if any of
the previously observed environmental conditions is reencountered. As we show
here, applying these evolutionary-based principles leads to accelerated and
improved adaptive evolution in a non-stable environment.},

abstract = {The robotics research community has clearly acknowledged the need
of open and standard software stacks to promote reuse of code and
developments. However, to date no particular project has prevailed. We suggest
that one possible reason for this is that most middleware do not address
issues specific to robotics, such as writing, monitoring, and debugging
real-time behaviors close to hardware. In this light, we present aseba, an
event-based architecture for mobile robots with microcontrollers and a Linux
board. In these, the microcontrollers manage sensors and actuators locally and
the Linux board runs the high- of microcontrollers are increasing. Aseba
achieves vertical integration by bringing the facilities of scripting inside
the microcontrollers and by bridging them with programs running on Linux. To
program the microcontrollers, aseba provides an integrated development
environment. The latter compiles a simple scripting language into bytecode
which runs in the virtual machines. We demonstrate a robot remote control
application where low-level scripts prevent collisions. At the Linux level,
this application employs both Perl and Python programs which communicate with
aseba through D-Bus (D-Bus is a middleware present by default under Linux).
This application shows how convenient it is to program all parts of the robot
thanks the vertical integration of aseba. We think that because it considers
the needs of robotics software development at all levels, the integrative
approach of aseba might be a way to overcome the stall in standardization.},
