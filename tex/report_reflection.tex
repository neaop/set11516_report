\section{Reflection}
This section of the report is intended to highlight the thoughts and opions of
the authors in regards to execution of the study, including; the management
and development techniques utilised during the project, as well as the personal
each of the authors personal thoughts of there own performance during the
course of the project.


\subsection{Project Scope}
In hindsight, the scope of this project was significantly larger than originally
anticipated.
This was in part due to the authors eagerness to participate in a thought
provoking and challenging investigation, and partly due to unknown number of
participants during the project's inception.
While it would have been wise to reduce the project's scope upon realisation
of there only being two participants, each member of the team had already made
headway with their respective investigation tasks, and it would have felt
wasteful or inefficient to simply stop progress on one half of the completed
work.
In reality, both team members had focused their effort on a single aspect of
the project - either the inexpensive SLAM solution, or the integrated robotic
simulator, it is likely that a suitably thorough investigation could have been
conducted - to the satisfaction of both team members.
