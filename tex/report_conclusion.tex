\section{Conclusion}
\editnote{Benefits of multiple sims - fast genetic/evolution approaches.}

The goal of this project was to provide an answer the following research
\begin{quote}
``Is it feasible for a robot to map an environment, simulate an optimal route
through said environment, and then execute the simulated route - without
external hardware or equipment?'' 
\end{quote}
As was discussed in the Evaluation section of this report, it was not possible
to implement the SLAM solution required to fully explore and provide a
definitive answer the above question.
Had the robotic platform utilised in this study implemented some form of
odometry, or more accurate environmental sensors, it may have been possible to
produce a answer for the question as a whole, but as it stands, only
simulation portion of the question can be addressed.


As is made clear by the results goatherd from expire mention with robotic
simulators, it is possible for a simulation software to be made sufficiently
small or computationally inexpensive that is can be integrated directly with a
mobile robotic system.



As the use of non-deterministic behaviour is common, both with comer cal
and academic technologies, the benefits of systems being able to perform self
simulation and discovery based improvement are clear.
