\section{Reflection}
This section of the report is intended to highlight the thoughts and opions of
the authors in regards to execution of the study, including; the management
and development techniques utilised during the project, as well as the personal
each of the authors personal thoughts of there own performance during the
course of the project.


\subsection{Project Scope}
In hindsight, the scope of this project was significantly larger than originally
anticipated.
This was in part due to the authors eagerness to participate in a thought
provoking and challenging investigation, and partly due to unknown number of
participants during the project's inception.
While it would have been wise to reduce the project's scope upon realisation
of there only being two participants, each member of the team had already made
headway with their respective investigation tasks, and it would have felt
wasteful or inefficient to simply stop progress on one half of the completed
work.
In reality, both team members had focused their effort on a single aspect of
the project - either the inexpensive SLAM solution, or the integrated robotic
simulator, it is likely that a suitably thorough investigation could have been
conducted - to the satisfaction of both team members.


\subsection{Project Management}
Due to the small size of the development team, an Agile management and
workflow system was utilised to aid in the direction of the project and its
deliverables.
The main agile technique employed was short, but regular work sprints - 
typically between one to two weeks, where each team member would work on
specific task, and aim to complete said task by the end of the sprint period.
Due to academic and personal commitments, it was not always possible for a task
to be completed within a sprint period, but as said academic commitments
occurred for both team members, there was a mutual understanding of these
occurrences.

An unseen side effect of the project's goals is that they split into two
distinct domains - the robotic SLAM implementation and the integrated
simulator, meaning each author could focus entirely on a single project
concept.
While splitting the investigation in this manner had its advantages, it was a
double edged sword, as each author could become entirely engrossed in a task
without needing, or requesting input from the other project participant.
This unintended task solitude could have been remedied by either reducing the
scope of the project to a single domain, or by increasing the number of
members on the team - thereby creating a scenario where multiple participants
would be working on a single project goal (and also reducing the overall work
load of each participant).

Even though the project's developmental tasks were completed individually,
regular team meetings were conducted as per the Agile management
recommendations.
Due to the shared academic commitments of both team members, and the shared
space in which they worked it was possible to conduct multiple meetings a
week, thought the course of the project.
While these ad hoc meetings featured the benefit of regularity, the high rate
at which they were conducted reduced the overall importance of each individual
meeting - leading to lax meeting requirements or unfinished orders of business.
While there is no doubting the usefulness of regular meetings and discussions,
both for the planning and discussion of project aims and deliverables
progress - had a more formal meeting style been adopted each individual meeting
might have carried more weight - causing project advancement to have progress
in a different style (for better or for worse, cannot be said).

In terms of tools utilised for the management of the team and the project,
Slack was used extensively for communication between the team members,
determining project goals, deciding of sprint goals, and sharing of literate
or papers to aid in development.
Additionally, Git version control allowed each of the authors to keep track
each other progress and share code with one another.
While it was the case that most of the development task were segregated, there
were occasions where suggestions for improvements or bug-fixes were exchanged
utilising the source-code management tool.

Overall, the management of the project proved effective, while it might have
been the case that each author was overly confined to a single deliverable,
it did allow each developer to focus entirely on a single domain - effectively
letting each team member develop specialist knowledge in a domain of their
inters.
Arguable the biggest short coming of the project's management was allowing
the scope of the investigation to remain as large as its inception - leading
to the effective production of two smaller projects, rather than a single
cohesive investigation.
